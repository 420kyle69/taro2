## Node Version
Node Versions below [14](https://nodejs.org) are not supported due to package incompatibility and degraded performance.

## Running a game server
Taro engine will run games made using [modd.io](https://www.modd.io).

To run the game server, execute the following command:
```
npm run server
```
*The engine will use game.json stored in `/src` directory.

You can download Game JSON from your modd.io in-game editor. Go to `Editor` -> Click `Export JSON`.

Alternatively, you can download Game JSON from your modd.io's game's sandbox. ([example](https://modd.io/edit/two-houses)). Go to `Menu` -> Click `Export JSON`.

Next, rename the downloaded Game JSON as `game.json` and move it to the `./src` directory.

## Quick start example - Run "Two Houses" locally

Install [Node 14](https://nodejs.org) or later and then...

```
git clone https://github.com/moddio/taro2.git
cd taro2
npm install
npm run server
```

## Connecting to the game server
Visit http://localhost:80 to start testing game.

## Compiling game.js for faster loading
Once you  make changes, run 
```
npm run build
```
and edit /src/index.ejs file, and comment
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="/engine/loader.js"></script>
```
and uncomment
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="./game.js"></script>
```

## How to customize game client UI
Game client's user interface is rendered by [/src/index.ejs](https://github.com/moddio/taro2/blob/master/src/index.ejs) file and the theme files in [/src/templates/](https://github.com/moddio/taro2/tree/master/src/templates)
