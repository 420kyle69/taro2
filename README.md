## How do I create a new game from scratch?
Moddio games are created & edited using Moddio Game Editor available at [https://www.modd.io](https://www.modd.io).
To learn how to use the game editor, visit [https://learn.modd.io](https://learn.modd.io).

Once you create the game, you can export the game.json which you can use in your local installation.
Inside the Moddio Game Editor, Go to `Menu` -> Click `Export Game`.
